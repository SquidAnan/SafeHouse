# SaveHouse
You got your own space. For everything you like. So do your friends.

## Todo
* Read homepage content from file, not directly write in HTML.
* Theme importer. General card style and style for each widget
* PWA
* Maybe try to use godot for interface prototype? Even production? So you can take more rendering or game logic feature to Web? Even for Native Cross-platform SaveHoue client?
