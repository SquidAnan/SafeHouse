## Todo

- Theme importer. General card style and style for each widget
- Maybe try to use godot for interface prototype? Even production? So you can
  take more rendering or game logic feature to Web? Even for Native
  Cross-platform SafeHouse client?

## Why not using framework

I want to make it as simple as possible at least for the static site version, so
everyone whether using or not using frameworks can help the project. If the code
base is complicated enough to have a framework. The code base itself is too
complicated.
